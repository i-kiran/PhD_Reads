Some key points:
1. English/Flow
2. Hook! The hook should help the audience understand why the problem is interesting. It should give the audience something to grab onto, something that they can relate to/identify with/understand.
3. Is the problem statement clear?
4. Is it clear why the problem is challenging?
5. Is it clear that there is something novel/exciting/creative about your approach to solving the problem?
6. Is it clear that your solution works and/or that youâ€™ve learned something of importance?
7. Does everything you are saying make sense for your audience? Imho, it is better to assume less than more.
8. Teaser? Are there some obvious next questions?  Have you left the audience wanting to know more?
